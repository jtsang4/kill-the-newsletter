            <p class="text-text-muted leading-relaxed">
              Create a feed with the form above and Kill the Newsletter! provides you with an email address and an Atom feed. Emails that are received at that address are turned into entries in that feed. Sign up to a newsletter with that address and use your feed reader to subscribe to that feed.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section class="bg-surface rounded-2xl p-8 border border-border">
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-text mb-4">How do I confirm my newsletter subscription?</h2>
            <p class="text-text-muted leading-relaxed">
              In most cases when you subscribe to a newsletter the publisher sends you an email with a confirmation link. Kill the Newsletter! converts that email into a feed entry as usual, so it appears in your feed reader and you may follow the confirmation link from there. Some publishers want you to reply to an email—this is not supported; consider contacting them or forwarding from your regular email as a workaround.

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-text mb-4">Why can't I subscribe to a newsletter with my Kill the Newsletter! email?</h2>
            <p class="text-text-muted leading-relaxed">
              Some publishers block Kill the Newsletter!. You may contact them and ask them to reconsider. As a workaround, subscribe with your regular address and set up a forwarder to your Kill the Newsletter! address.

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-text mb-4">How do I share a Kill the Newsletter! feed?</h2>
            <p class="text-text-muted leading-relaxed">
              You don't. The feed includes the identifier for the email address and anyone who has access to it may unsubscribe you or send spam. Share the service instead and let people create their own feeds.

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-text mb-4">Why are old entries disappearing?</h2>
            <p class="text-text-muted leading-relaxed">
              To keep the feed under a size limit compatible with some readers, old entries are deleted when new emails arrive and the feed would exceed the limit.

            <p class="text-text-muted leading-relaxed">
              Send an email to your feed address and wait a few minutes. If it shows up, the issue is on the publisher side; otherwise contact support.
